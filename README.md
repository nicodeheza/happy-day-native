# Happy Day Native

React Native Expo app

## About This Project

This is a React Native adaptation of other of my projects. The original project is a MERN stack application. [Here is the repository of the original project.](https://github.com/nicodeheza/happy-day)

Both projects share the API. If you want to see the backend code, go to the original app repository.

The app was only tested and built on Android and the code is not optimized for iOS. This is because I am not an Apple user so it is very difficult for me to develop for iOS.

If you want to test the app [here you can download the Android APK.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AnV87mdeIMaxnPPrXJjK0thwPIdt-XvL?usp=sharing)
